## Intended audience for my website?
When you creating a website it is important to know your target audience.

The website need to have all the information about the camp and all the information about the activities your camp has to offer. The website should be easy to navigate when visitors visit your website so they should able to find what they looking for which is information about the camp, how to sign up, prices, visas and travel insurance.
